                <h1>Enumerations in Ribbon</h1>
                <div class="date">March 14, 2025</div>

                <p>Enums are a classic staple of programing languages. Ever since Algol
                    I've heard. Enums with associated values are even better. Apparently
                    introduced by Eiffel.</p>
                <p>Here's enums in Ribbon:</p>
                <pre class="ribbon"><code>let E = enum {
    VariantA(x: Int, y: String)
    VariantB
}

let e = E.VariantA(x: 32, y: &quot;Hi&quot;)

match e {
    .VariantA(x, y) =&gt; print(&quot;VariantA: x=\(x) y=\(y)&quot;)
    .VariantB() =&gt; print(&quot;VariantB&quot;)
}</code></pre>
                <p>And, as usual, some details:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enum variants are their own type. For example, a function that takes
                        only an <code>E.VariantA</code> would have a signature like
                        <code>(x: E.VariantA) -&gt; ()</code>. Calling it with a
                        <code>E.VariantB</code> would yield an error. This is similar to failing
                        an arbitrary constraint, where the function call as a whole would return
                        an error value. It would be implemented as a runtime check in the
                        general case, but this can be optimized during static analysis if the
                        argument is known to always be a <code>E.VariantA</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enum variant literals don't need to explicitly state which enum they
                        belong to. A variant without an enum name can be constructed and
                        implicitly converted, such as in:
                        <code>let e: E = .VariantA(x: 32, y: "Hi")</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>In fact, the enum name being optional has some interesting
                        implications. From the sample above, we can delete all mentions of
                        <code>E</code>, including the entire enum declaration. This is not a
                        good practice, but it certainly does make prototyping fast. Here's what
                        it would look like:
                        <pre class="ribbon"><code>let e = .VariantA(x: 32, y: &quot;Hi&quot;)

match e {
    .VariantA(x, y) =&gt; print(&quot;VariantA: x=\(x) y=\(y)&quot;)
    .VariantB() =&gt; print(&quot;VariantB&quot;)
}</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>But that's not all! I've implemented joining for enums!</p>
                <pre><code>let OkResult = enum {
    ResultPage(result: Result, nextPage: () -&gt; OkResult)
    End
}

let ErrorResult = enum {
    NoInternet
    RateLimitExceeded
    InvalidCredentials
}

let Result = OkResult | ErrorResult</code></pre>
                <p>I haven't started implementing a standard library yet, but I imagine
                    this will be a useful mechanism for encapsulating possible error types
                    for a lot of IO methods.</p>
                <p>Just to be clear, this does tolerate name collisions. For
                    example:</p>
                <pre><code>let E1 = enum { A, B }
let E2 = enum { A, C }

let E = E1 | E2

E.B // Equivalent to E1.B
E.A // Not allowed, must be disambiguated as `E1.A` or `E2.A`</code></pre>
                <h2>Associated values as
                    structs (or tuples)</h2>
                <p>Enum variants with associated values are nothing more than structs.
                    In last week's post, I described how to instantiate struct literals, but
                    I didn't describe how to declare their types. That wasn't intentional,
                    but I can remedy that for you now.</p>
                <p>Here's 4 enum variants that are roughly equivalent:</p>
                <pre class="ribbon"><code>enum {
    VariantA(x: Int, y: String) // Struct with type hints
    VariantB(x:, y:)            // Struct without type hints
    VariantC(:Int, :String)     // Tuple with type hints
    VariantD(:, :)              // Tuple without type hints
}</code></pre>
                <p>I know you must be wondering what happens without colons. I kind of
                    struggled with this, since there are common uses of declaring a tuple
                    with type hints, e.g. <code>(Int, String)</code> (like how Rust does
                    it), and declaring a struct without type hints, e.g.
                    <code>(x, y)</code>. Many languages would disambiguate by having structs
                    use <code>{x, y}</code>. But I'm not faltering, yet! I'm going with the
                    safe approach of making it an error to not include colons. But we'll see
                    if I have to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>What about enums values?</h2>
                <p>Yes, yes. Enums traditionally just have one value per variant. In
                    fact, that's entirely how I've implemented them!</p>
                <pre class="ribbon"><code>enum {
    VariantA(x: Int, y: String)
    VariantA = (x: Int, y: String) // same as above

    VariantB = 123

    VariantC       // Has a globally unique and undescribed value
}</code></pre>
                <p>Yes, that's right, the struct declaration
                    <code>(x: Int, y: String)</code> is the variant's value! I'll have to
                    make another post describing how I treat types as values, including
                    struct/tuple types.
                </p>
                <p>Now, it's probably not a good idea for some variants to be types
                    while others are values. This can be fixed by putting a constraint on
                    the values of the enum.</p>
                <pre class="ribbon"><code>enum : Int {
    VariantA = 1
    VariantB = 2
    VariantC     // Not allowed! Enum variants do not get implicit integer values!
}</code></pre>
                <p>Also, you may have noticed that unlike most languages, Ribbon enums
                    are usually not named. Well, you can name them yourself, using a
                    variable, as in <code>let E = enum {...}</code>. This is another aspect
                    of types being values. However, I believe I can compromise and also
                    allow enum names to be specified in the enum expression, like other
                    languages.</p>
                <pre><code>enum E { ... }

// identical to

let E = enum { ... }</code></pre>
                <p>Now, don't get any funny ideas! Just because enum types are not named
                    doesn't mean they can be confused for each other. Each
                    <code>enum {...}</code> creation can be thought of as having a globally
                    unique (and undescribed) discriminant, which means they never
                    collide.
                </p>
                <pre><code>let E = enum {
    VariantA
}

let e = {
    // New scope! This shadows the previous enum E
    let E = enum {
        VariantA
    }

    E.VariantA // The return value of this block, which stores into `e`
}

print(e == E.VariantA) // Prints false!</code></pre>
                <p>Also, a bonus. Since enum blocks can just be declared on the fly, you
                    can do cool things for prototyping! For example...</p>
                <pre><code>let some_function(...) -&gt; enum {
    StatusA
    StatusB
} = {
    ...

    .StatusB // This is the return value again
}</code></pre>
                <p>Pretty nice, huh! This is a feature I wanted in other languages for
                    so long, and now it's finally here!</p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>So, that's Ribbon's enums! I hope you found this fascinating! I'm
                    still not sure what topic I'll present to you next week, but you can
                    definitely expect another post. I might discuss types as values and how
                    it fits into templates, or maybe I'll share some interesting
                    implementation details of my interpreter written in Rust. Regardless, until
                    then, take care!</p>
