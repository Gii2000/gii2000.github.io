                <p>Welcome back! Today, I wanted to talk about variables in Ribbon. But first, let's review my
                    motivation!</p>
                <h2>The ultimate variable</h2>
                <p>In Rust, there is an <em>ultimate</em> variable type. It's an
                    <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. It has the most utility for any variable type. But what is
                    it?
                </p>
                <p>Broken down:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>Arc</code> means atomically reference counted. This means that the value can be shared by
                        references without deep copying, and these references are tracked (counted), thus garbage
                        collection is unnecessary. Additionally, this sharing can occur across different threads, since
                        the reference counting is thread-safe (atomic).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>RwLock</code> is a thread-safe read-write lock. It's a kind of mutex that allows interior
                        mutability. This means that even when sharing references, we do not violate Rust's strict policy
                        of unique mutable aliases, since obtaining a mutable reference can only be done (safely) by
                        using the <code>RwLock</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>But this is also the most expensive variable type. If you don't need sharing across threads, you can
                    use a thread-unsafe alternative: <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. If you don't need shared
                    mutability, you can use <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> (thread-safe) or <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>
                    (thread-unsafe). If you don't need sharing at all, you can use the traditional <code>T</code> or
                    <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.
                </p>
                <p>This has always bothered me. The implementation you should pick comes simply from your needs.
                    Theoretically the compiler has all of the knowledge about a variable's usage, and could pick the
                    ideal implementation for you. If it cannot for whatever reason (e.g. the variable is exported and
                    therefore has unknown usage), then using the default <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> (if
                    mutable) or <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> (if immutable) is always the best and safest choice.</p>
                <p>From a programmer's perspective, it would be very nice if every variable was treated as Rust's
                    <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> type, and then based on usage, the optimizer could choose a
                    better implementation.
                </p>
                <p>Now, there are some cases where a Rust programmer would tell you that they chose an implementation
                    because of a hard constraint. That is a valid concern in some cases. But even in this case, Rust's
                    approach doesn't explicitly state what that constraint <em>was</em>. For example, it's quite easy
                    for a developer to refactor an <code>Rc</code> into an <code>Arc</code> <em>just to &quot;fix a
                        bug&quot;</em>, not realizing they defeated the whole point of using an <code>Rc</code> for a
                    specific reason. I designed Ribbon to explicitly state these constraints.</p>
                <h2>Ribbon's variable semantics</h2>
                <p>In Ribbon, you can declare a variable as:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-ribbon">var x: T   // Corresponds to Rust's `Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;`
let x: T   // Corresponds to Rust's `Arc&lt;T&gt;`
</code></pre>
                <p>If, for whatever performance reason, you do not want atomic reference counting, and hence cannot
                    share the reference across threads, you would impose a constraint <code>@Local</code>.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-ribbon">var x: T and @Local   // Corresponds to Rust's `Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;`
let x: T and @Local   // Corresponds to Rust's `Rc&lt;T&gt;`
</code></pre>
                <p>If you want <em>everything</em> within a block to be local, you can just provide the constraint to
                    the whole block.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-ribbon">@Local {
    var x: T   // Corresponds to Rust's `Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;`
    let x: T   // Corresponds to Rust's `Rc&lt;T&gt;`

    ...
}
</code></pre>
                <p>And if you want something in a <code>@Local</code> block to be thread-safe, you can use
                    <code>@Global</code> inside. Additionally, if you need a variable to actually be stored by value
                    (e.g. a plain <code>T</code> in Rust), you can use <code>@Owned</code>. Note that
                    <code>@Local</code>, <code>@Global</code>, and <code>@Owned</code> constraints may change names in
                    the future as I better refine their semantics.
                </p>
                <p>Also note that the shared reference-counting is only a <em>semantic</em> modeling for how variables
                    work. Depending on usage or the particular data types involved, the optimizer may change their
                    implementation to a more efficient one.</p>
                <h2>Copy on write</h2>
                <p>Similar to Swift, Ribbon uses copy-on-write semantics.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-ribbon">var a = big_list
let b = a        // `b` and `a` both share `big_list`. No copy occurs yet.

a ++= [42]       // `a` is mutated while `b` has the old value. A clone occurs.
</code></pre>
                <p>The implementation gets a little complex to fully support this, which I describe later in this post.
                </p>
                <h2>Shared references</h2>
                <p>If you do want to have two variables refer to the same place in memory, you can used shared mutable
                    references. This looks like:</p>
                <pre><code>var a = 12
let &amp;b = &amp;a

a := 13
print(b) // 13
</code></pre>
                <p>You can kind of interpret the second line as &quot;Let the address of <code>b</code> be equal to the
                    address of <code>a</code>&quot;. It has a very satisfying elegance, don't you think?</p>
                <h2>Scaffolding</h2>
                <p>There's an additional mechanism I'm calling scaffolding. The idea is quite simple: what if you could
                    do element access on a element that doesn't exist yet?</p>
                <pre><code class="language-ribbon">var x = [1, 2]

x[2] := 3

print(x) // [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
                <p>You've probably seen this is some languages before, like JavaScript. But scaffolding extends to all
                    collection types to any arbitrary depth! Check this out!</p>
                <pre><code class="language-ribbon">var x = []

x[0].a := 1
x[0].b.c := &quot;Hi&quot;
x[0].b.d := &quot;Hello&quot;

print(x) // [(a: 1, b: (c: &quot;Hi&quot;, d: &quot;Hello&quot;))]
</code></pre>
                <p>I'm calling it scaffolding because you can &quot;scaffold&quot; up your struct or list. Any
                    &quot;empty&quot; place that <em>could exist</em> permits element access <em>as if it did
                        exist</em>. Though the semantics of Ribbon only actually allocates storage if assignment is
                    performed or a mutable reference is created. Otherwise it defaults to a empty value
                    (<code>null</code>) and doesn't allocate any storage at all.</p>
                <p>In particular, I'm calling a reference to an element that doesn't exist yet a <em>scaffold</em>. For
                    example, the <code>x[0].b.c</code> from above is a scaffold since it denotes a place in memory which
                    doesn't exist yet, but that will be constructed in that line of code.</p>
                <h3>Internal implementation (advanced)</h3>
                <p>Because of shared mutable references, the actual internal representation of a variable in the
                    interpreter I have written in Rust uses an <code>Arc&lt;Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;Value&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
                    The outer <code>Arc</code> is for shared mutable references, the inner <code>Arc</code> is used for
                    sharing values as part of copy-on-write, and the <code>RwLock</code> allows the interior mutability.
                </p>
                <p>Here's how the operations work.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shared mutable references</strong>: Declaring a shared mutable reference (e.g.
                        <code>let &amp;b = &amp;a</code>) just clones the outer <code>Arc</code> from <code>a</code>
                        into <code>b</code>. The inner <code>Arc</code> and the <code>RwLock&lt;Value&gt;</code> are
                        shared without being copied.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Copies</strong>: Declaring a copy (e.g. <code>let b = a</code>) just clones the outer
                        and inner <code>Arc</code> from <code>a</code> into <code>b</code>. The
                        <code>RwLock&lt;Value&gt;</code> is shared without being copied.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Assignments</strong>: Assigning to a variable (e.g. <code>b := 123</code>) replaces the
                        value of the <code>RwLock</code>, requiring the inner <code>Arc</code> be unshared (i.e. have a
                        strong count of 1) by deep cloning it as necessary. This is called <em>copy-on-write</em>. For
                        example:
                        <pre><code class="language-ribbon">var a = [1, 2]
let b = a      // `b` and `a` share the same `RwLock&lt;Value&gt;`

a[2].c := 3    // This assignment clones the list, then edits index 2

print(a) // [1, 2, (c: 3)]
print(b) // [1, 2]
</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Hopefully you can see here that the variables in Ribbon are extremely flexible. They are designed to
                    make prototyping easy, especially with scaffolds! However, once the optimizer phase is built, the
                    concrete implementation of a variable can be optimized according to how it is used. It's the best of
                    both flexibility and performance!</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoyed this blog entry! Next week I'll finally be discussing enums. Until then, take
                    care!</p>
