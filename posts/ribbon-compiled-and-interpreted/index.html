                <h1>Compiled vs. interpreted languages</h1>
                <div class="date">February 21, 2025</div>

                <p>The traditional distinction between compiled and interpreted languages used to be quite clear:
                    compiled languages like Fortran and COBOL must translate their source code into machine code before
                    they are executed on a processor, while interpreted languages like Lisp and BASIC execute their
                    source code immediately. However, this line has blurred as interpreted languages like Python and
                    Ruby came out which use bytecode internally, alongside compiled languages like Java and C# which
                    also compile to and execute from their own bytecode.</p>
                <p>In this fashion, modern interpreters do &quot;compile&quot; their source code, and many modern
                    compilers are tightly developed with an interpreter, such as Java's JVM, or C#'s CLR.</p>
                <p>However, there is still a very clear distinction between a language &quot;feeling&quot; like it's
                    compiled or interpreted. The way I see it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compiled languages catch type and semantic errors at compile time, preventing execution until
                        they are resolved.</li>
                    <li>Interpreted languages defer most if not all checks to runtime, meaning the program may execute
                        partially before encountering an issue which stops the program.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then you're probably wondering: When does Ribbon check errors? Interestingly, I've designed it to
                    catch errors both at compile time and at runtime. I really mean it. A compile-time error is also
                    shown at runtime, and similarly a runtime error is shown at compile-time (pending some formal
                    verification). Even beyond that, runtime errors do not terminate the program if they don't have to.
                    Here's an example using actual outputs from my current interpreter:</p>
                <pre><code>let x = 34

let y = x + z

print(x)

y
</code></pre>
                <pre><code>Executing program...
Warning: Undeclared identifier `z`
    3 | let y = x + z
      |             ^

(34)
Returned value:
Error: Undeclared identifier `z`
    3 | let y = x + z
      |             ^
</code></pre>
                <p>Once Ribbon has a static analysis phase, the warning here will appear before execution starts, but it
                    will not prevent execution. The error you see there really is the value of <code>y</code> (the final
                    expression in a program is its return value). Evaluating <code>y</code>'s declaration didn't even
                    prevent the next statement <code>print(x)</code> from running! Isn't that incredible?</p>
                <h2>Fallibility and error handling</h2>
                <p>Ribbon has a <code>null</code> literal which belongs to the type <code>Null</code>, a subtype of
                    <code>Error</code>. Indeed, this makes <code>null</code> the easiest error to construct. Errors in
                    Ribbon behave similarly to NaNs in floating-point arithmetic: they are contagious. If an operation
                    involves an error, its result propagates that error.
                </p>
                <p>Bonus fact: Ribbon does not allow NaN as a valid value of floating-point numbersâ€”it is instead an
                    instance of <code>Error</code>. If you did want a type representing floating point numbers and NaN,
                    you can use <code>Float?</code>. The question mark denotes fallibility, which acts a lot like an
                    optional. It either has a non-null value or it has an error value which always compares equal to
                    <code>null</code>. (Finally, no need to worry about floats only partially implementing comparison
                    operators! I'm sure Rust programmers will appreciate that!)
                </p>
                <p>I have a pretty insightful example that I think motivates how I view error handling in Ribbon.</p>
                <pre><code>let divide(a: Real, b: Real) -&gt; Real = {
    a / b
}
</code></pre>
                <p>In this sample, <code>divide</code> is a fallible function. If <code>b</code> is zero, then
                    <code>a / b</code> is undefined, and the return value will not be a member of <code>Real</code>. The
                    idea is that this would be detected during static analysis, and consequently any usage of
                    <code>divide</code> in other code would be fallible (i.e. the result of <code>divide</code> could be
                    an error value, as if the return type was <code>Real?</code>). At the very least, the declaration of
                    the <code>divide</code> function yields a warning: &quot;<code>divide</code> is a fallible function
                    because it is undefined for <code>b = 0</code>&quot;. We can suppress this warning simply by making
                    the return type be <code>Real?</code> to explicitly state the function is fallible.
                </p>
                <p>However, this is not the best solution. Ribbon supports preconditions, so we can actually express
                    division this way:</p>
                <pre><code>let divide(a: Real, b: Real and b != 0) -&gt; Real = {
    a / b
}</code></pre>
                <p>The parameter <code>b</code> now has a precondition that it is not 0. Thus, the division
                    <code>a / b</code> is always defined. It is now up to the caller to enforce the precondition. If the
                    caller can prove <code>b</code> is always non-zero, then from the caller's perspective,
                    <code>divide</code> is infallible. But if the caller cannot prove <code>b</code> is always non-zero,
                    then from their perspective, <code>divide</code> actually has the function type
                    <code>(Real, Real) -&gt; Real?</code>.
                </p>
                <p>I also want to mention that fallible types can also be expressed as <code>T | E</code>, for any type
                    <code>T</code> and any error type <code>E</code>, if for any reason you want the error type to be
                    explicit. You can even chain it: <code>T | E1 | E2 | ...</code>. This is one of the ways to safely
                    handle fallible types and make the code as a whole infallible.
                </p>
                <p>There's a few big takeaways from designing Ribbon this way that are worth emphasizing.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Errors in Ribbon are preferably not handled or &quot;caught&quot;. If an error could be avoided,
                        it should be because there is a precondition that could have been enforced which avoids the
                        error, just like in the <code>divide</code> example above.</li>
                    <li>If you do really need to handle &quot;errors&quot; (i.e. HTTP 404 and the like), you should
                        first consider using enums. Enums are very handy and easy to use in Ribbon. For example,
                        programmers can easily assume an enum only yields one or a few variants, and not handle the
                        rest. Only in those unhandled cases can an error be created. Basically, it is at the point of
                        usage where a programmer can choose how much they want to handle and if they are willing to
                        create fallible code or not.</li>
                    <li>If you <em>really</em> do need to handle and unwrap actual <code>Error</code> objects, there are
                        concessions in Ribbon to allow it, but it's a last resort. I'll have to describe this later at
                        some point, perhaps in actual documentation.</li>
                    <li>Since errors are valid values at runtime, they do not block the program from ever compiling or
                        running. But they do make the program as a whole fallible, and fallible programs are not easily
                        shared as libraries. I'm thinking that users who use a &quot;fallible&quot; library must
                        acknowledge it, and their own project becomes fallible as a result unless all inherited errors
                        are handled.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I also have some ambitious goals for Ribbon with respect to formal verification. For example, I would
                    love if Ribbon could enforce memory usage. I dream of static analysis within the compiler proving
                    that a Ribbon program can be guaranteed to never use more than a given amount of memory (for both
                    the stack and heap individually) for a given platform. This would be amazing for usage in embedded
                    systems and the like.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>In the traditional sense, Ribbon is currently just interpreted for now, but the language is designed
                    to be compiled to CPUs or even GPUs. I am designing it to be suitable for usage as a systems
                    programming language after all. I just haven't gotten there yet with development.</p>
                <p>Since Ribbon is designed to detect and catch errors at compile-time and at runtime, I think it is
                    fair to say Ribbon is both a compiled and interpreted language, or at least it certainly feels like
                    it is. These error semantics are very versatile, making prototyping incredibly easy, while also
                    giving Ribbon stringent and robust mechanisms to enforce program correctness. When a project grows
                    past its prototyping phase and wants more reliability, preconditions can be added incrementally to
                    reduce the amount of fallible code over time.</p>
                <p>I hope you find these ideas fascinating! I'll see you next week where I'll talk about tuples,
                    structs, and enums in Ribbon. Until then, take care!</p>
