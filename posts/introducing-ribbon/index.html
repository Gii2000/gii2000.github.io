                <h1>Introducing Ribbon, a new programming language!</h1>
                <div class="date">February 14, 2025</div>

                <p>Hello world!</p>
                <p>My name is Gaelan, I'm a software engineer who's had his fair share of work experiences, hobby
                    projects, interests, and ambitions. I've always imagined having a blog, so here we are! There's
                    nothing to it but to do it!</p>
                <p>I wanted to share with you a project that I have been brainstorming and working on for many
                    years: Ribbon! It's a new programming language, one designed to be very easy to prototype in, like
                    Python, but also provide robust mechanisms to support strong runtime guarantees, like Rust.</p>
                <p>Ribbon is still in alpha, though I'm preparing for a beta release soon. Perhaps the quickest way for
                    me to introduce it to you is with code samples. I've created three that hopefully show you what
                    Ribbon is capable of.</p>
                <h2>Sample 1: For the data scientists</h2>
                <pre><code>let halve(x) = x / 2

let halve_plus_one = halve + 1

let y = halve_plus_one( [1, 2, null, 4] )

let squared_y = y ^ 2

print(squared_y) // [2.25, 4, null, 9]

print(squared_y[# - 1]) // 9
</code></pre>
                <p>As you can see, it is extremely flexible! I know you must have questions, so here's some
                    technical details.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ribbon is designed to be statically typed, though it does support dynamic types to accommodate
                        the prototyping process. For example, in this case, <code>halve</code> has the inferred type
                        <code>&lt;T: Numeric&gt; (x: T) -> T</code>. Yes, it is templated, but unlike C++, Ribbon
                        supports calling templated functions when the type is only known at runtime. I'll discuss this
                        process more in my next post.
                    </li>
                    <li>Integers are a separate type from other numerics, such as rationals and reals, but they can all
                        be implicitly converted between each other if the conversion is sound.</li>
                    <li>Like Python, the integer type <code>Int</code> has infinite precision. There is also a rational
                        type which also has infinite precision. However, there are also fixed-size variants, such as
                        <code>Int&lt;32&gt;</code>. You'll see this in the next sample.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>halve_plus_one</code> is identical to the lambda <code>(x) =&gt; halve(x) + 1</code>.
                        Pretty nifty, right? I'll discuss how it works in a future post.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any operations or functions applied to lists (or iterables in general) are applied element-wise.
                        There is no ambiguity because operators only operate on lists or on non-lists, never both. For
                        example, the sum operator <code>+</code> does not operate on lists, whereas the concatenation
                        operator <code>++</code> only operates on lists. I'm glossing over some technical details that
                        I'll discuss in another post sometime.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <code>null</code> value is encapsulated by fallible types, denoted <code>T?</code> for some
                        type <code>T</code>. Be rest assured, <code>null</code> is never a legal value in a non-fallible
                        setting. I'll describe <code>null</code>, fallibility, and error-handling in general in a future
                        post.</li>
                    <li>Yes, exponentiation is done with the <code>^</code> operator, you're welcome. The operator for
                        bitwise XOR (and bitwise NOT) is <code>~</code>. They're not ambiguous because one is unary
                        and the other is binary. You should know that this idea is not mine, but Dennis Ritchie's,
                        though I cannot find the source I originally heard this from.</li>
                    <li>The <code># - 1</code> in the index means what you think it means. The <code>#</code> operator
                        refers to the length of the list, and subtracting one gives us the index of the last item. It is
                        identical to <code>squared_y[#squared_y - 1]</code>, where the unary <code>#</code> operator
                        returns the length of the list, just like Lua.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Do you like it? I hope you don't think of Ribbon as simply a revamped Python. There's a lot more work
                    I've done to make it useful for other tasks, such as...</p>
                <h2>Sample 2: For the systems programmers</h2>
                <pre><code>let XState : @Binary = (
    state: Int&lt;10&gt;
    flags: Bin&lt;6&gt;
)

let state = 0x208 + 42
let flags: Bin&lt;6&gt; = 0b11 ++ 0x6
// Like Rust, type hints (e.g. `Bin&lt;6&gt;`) are optional

let x = XState(state, flags)

let x_bin = Bin&lt;16&gt;(x)
</code></pre>
                <p>Some more details:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The <code>@Binary</code> directive tells Ribbon to pack the struct fields in the order presented
                        (in little endian). In general, structs do not promise an exact layout unless a directive
                        requires
                        it.</li>
                    <li>Struct fields, and all other multi-line collections, do not need commas at the end of each line.
                        They are inferred by newlines and indentation. I might make a post just about this feature;
                        there's some interesting details.</li>
                    <li>The binary type <code>Bin</code> is distinct from the integer type <code>Int</code>. Notably:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>Bin</code> supports addition and other non-bitwise numeric operations through an
                                implicit conversion into an <code>Int</code>. The conversion
                                back from <code>Int</code> to <code>Bin</code> must be explicit.
                            </li>
                            <li>Unlike <code>Bin</code>, <code>Int</code> does not natively have bitwise operations nor
                                concatenation (<code>++</code>).</li>
                            <li>Binary literals have an inferred type. For example, <code>0o000</code> (octal) has the
                                type <code>Bin&lt;9&gt;</code>. As a fun fact, integer literals (e.g. <code>42</code>)
                                actually have a type of <code>Bin</code> (a binary number with arbitrarily many bits).
                                They can of course be implicitly converted to an <code>Int</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Structs that have the <code>@Binary</code> directive can be converted into <code>Bin</code> and
                        vice versa.</li>
                    <li>Sharp observers will notice that <code>++</code> operates on <code>Bin</code>, which implies
                        that <code>Bin</code> is actually a list type! It is equivalent to an array of Booleans. For
                        example, <code>0xC4[2]</code> equals <code>true</code>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I have one more sample that explores some of the more technical ideas I have for Ribbon.</p>
                <h2>Sample 3: For the software engineers</h2>
                <pre><code>let apply(
    document: &Document
    action: Action
    history: &amp;List&lt;Action&gt;
    log: &amp;List&lt;Issue&gt;
) -&gt; (
    size_change_kiB: Int
    new_issues: List&lt;Issue&gt;
) = {
    let (size_change, issues) = action.apply_to(&document)

    &amp;history.push(action)
    &amp;log.append(issues)

    (size_change, new_issues: issues)
}

let undo_last_action(
    document: &Document
    history: &amp;List&lt;Action&gt; and #_ &gt; 0
    log: &amp;List&lt;Issue&gt;
) -&gt; Action = {
    let last_action = &amp;history.pop()

    last_action.undo_to(&document)

    &amp;log.push(Issue.new("Undid action \(last_action)"))

    last_action
}

var (document, history, log) = load_document_history_and_logs()

let kiB = &amp;document.apply(format_text, &amp;history, &amp;log).size_change

&document.undo_last_action(&amp;history, &amp;log)

print("Formatting will change the file size by \(kiB * 1024) bytes")
</code></pre>
                <p>There's a lot here to unpack, so once more, I will try to answer as many questions as possible.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The <code>&amp;</code> here is equivalent to Rust's <code>&amp;mut</code>.</li>
                    <li>The return type of <code>apply</code> is indeed an inline struct declaration! You're welcome.
                    </li>
                    <li>Structs and tuples have been merged into tuples in Ribbon. I'll have to write about this too in
                        another
                        post.</li>
                    <li>If an argument is passed to a mutable parameter, even if it is used as <code>self</code>, it
                        must have the <code>&amp;</code> in front of it. This is to make all mutability apparent <em>in
                            the syntax</em>. There's another advantage that I'll discuss in a future post.</li>
                    <li>Similar to the D language, notation like <code>a.b(c)</code> is shorthand for
                        <code>b(a, c)</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Similar to Rust, the final expression in a function body (or any block in general) is
                        its return value. The <code>return</code> keyword is optional.
                    </li>
                    <li>The parameter constraint <code>&amp;List&lt;Action&gt; and #_ &gt; 0</code> has the meaning:<ul>
                            <li>A mutable reference to a <code>List&lt;Action&gt;</code></li>
                            <li>With the precondition: <code>#_ &gt; 0</code>, i.e. its length must be positive. This
                                expression is a lambda, identical to <code>(x) =&gt; #x &gt; 0</code>. This is because
                                <code>_</code> is the identity function, and operations can be applied to lambdas as
                                shown earlier.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Yes, you see it right, Ribbon supports arbitrary preconditions for parameters and other declarations!
                    For the time being, these are evaluated at runtime. But my plan (and it's a long plan) is that
                    Ribbon will incorporate formal verification, similar to Ada, allowing for compile-time checks and
                    optimization opportunities. Once again, I'll have to discuss it more in a future post.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I hope you're as excited about Ribbon as I am! There's more things I didn't have time to include
                    here, like iterables and generators, fallibility, objects and traits (and inheritance), modules and
                    dependencies, and much more. But I will mention that my goal for Ribbon is to be easier to prototype
                    in
                    than Python, while having stronger runtime guarantees than Rust. Do you think I'm on the right
                    track?</p>
                <p>As for my current progress, some the features I've shown here are already implemented in my
                    interpreter written in Rust. This project of course is still in its alpha stage as I still have many
                    bugs and holes in my implementation. I plan on releasing and open-sourcing it in the coming weeks,
                    plus I'll continue posting more blog posts here each Friday.</p>
                <p>Until then, take care! I'll see you next week when I'll discuss how Ribbon is both an interpreted
                    and compiled language!</p>
                <br>
                <p>P.S. It seems a language becomes real when it has a logo, so I made this one today. Enjoy!</p>
